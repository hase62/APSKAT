#This R code (aSKAT_func) has two main functions. 
------------------------------

"aSKAT_bfile" requires PLINK Binary files(header.bed, header.bim, header.fam), 
a file indicating SNP sets, and the fllowing arguments:

FUNCTION:
aSKAT_bfile(prefix, SNPSetID, significance_level = 0.05 / 20000, ID = "job", 
                      n.maxres = 5.0 / (0.05 / 20000), conf_1 = significance_level, 
					  conf_2 = conf_1, covariate = NA)
					  
(1)"prefix" indicates a prefix filename of PLINK Binary files. 
 (ex.) If one prepares aaa.bed, aaa.bim, and aaa.fam, set as prefix ="aaa". 
(2)"SNPSetID" indicates a file name including SNP sets. 
 The 1st and 2nd columns of the file must be set id (e.g., gene names) and snp id, respectively.
 (ex.) SNPSetID = "snpset.txt"
 A1CF	rs3829175
 A1CF	rs3954101
 A1CF	rs2664679
 A1CF	rs28653016
 ABCC2	rs514554
 ABCC2	rs1867073
 ABCC2	rs6584164
 ...	...
(3)"significance_level" indicates a Bonferroni corrected significance level.
 (ex.) significance_level = 0.05 / 20000 (default)
 (ex.) significance_level = 0.5 / #Genes.  
(4)"Id" is the prefix of intermediate files.
 job.Info, job.Info.TEMP.txt, job.SSD, and job.SSD_LOG.txt are generated when setting ID = "job".
 (ex.) ID = "job" (default)
(5)"n.maxres" is the maximum number of permutation test. 
 (ex.) n.maxres = 5 / (0.5 / 20000) (default)
 (ex.) n.maxres = 5 / (0.5 / #Genes)
(6)"conf_1": When the current estimated p is 0, the adaptive permutation test is finished when the probability of the event 
   assuming "the true p = significance_level" becomes lower than "conf_1". 
 (ex.) conf_1 =  significance_level (default)
(7)"conf_2": When the current estimated p is 1, the adaptive permutation test is finished when the probability of the event 
   assuming "the true p = significance_level * #Genes" becomes lower than "conf_2". 
 (ex.) conf_2 =  conf_1 (default)
(8)"covariate" indicates a file name including covariates for phenotypes. If one do not use it, one should set it as "NA".  
(ex.) covariate = NA (default). 
(ex) Sex, Age, and BMI. The first colum must be set IDs used in bfiles. 
NA19919 0	18	22.2
NA19916 1	43	25,2
NA19902 1	34	23.4
NA19901 1	23	28.1
NA19908 1	36	19.2
...	...	...	...

------------------------------

"aSKAT_matrix" requires Genotype Matrix, Phenotype Vector, and the fllowing arguments: 

FUNCTION:
aSKAT_matrix(geno_matrix, phenotype, significance_level = 0.05 / 20000, ID="job", 
                      n.maxres = 5.0 / (0.05 / 20000), conf_1 = significance_level, 
					  conf_2=conf_1, covariate=NA, is_dose=FALSE)
					  
(1)"geno_matrix" indicates Genotye Matrix as used in SKAT example, 
   see Manual(https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/SKAT/SKAT.pdf) or aSKAT_exe.r. 
(2)"phenotype" is a phenotype vector. as used in SKAT example, 
   see Manual(https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/SKAT/SKAT.pdf) or aSKAT_exe.r. 
(3)"significance_level" indicates a Bonferroni corrected significance level.
 (ex.) significance_level = 0.05 / 20000 (default)
 (ex.) significance_level = 0.5 / #Genes.  
(4)"Id" is the prefix of intermediate files.
 job.Info, job.Info.TEMP.txt, job.SSD, and job.SSD_LOG.txt are generated when setting ID = "job".
 (ex.) ID = "job" (default)
(5)"n.maxres" is the maximum number of permutation test. 
 (ex.) n.maxres = 5 / (0.5 / 20000) (default)
 (ex.) n.maxres = 5 / (0.5 / #Genes)
(6)"conf_1": When the current estimated p is 0, the adaptive permutation test is finished when the probability of the event 
   assuming "the true p = significance_level" becomes lower than "conf_1". 
 (ex.) conf_1 =  significance_level (default)
(7)"conf_2": When the current estimated p is 1, the adaptive permutation test is finished when the probability of the event 
   assuming "the true p = significance_level * #Genes" becomes lower than "conf_2". 
 (ex.) conf_2 =  conf_1 (default)
(8)"covariate" set a covariate matrix for phenotypes. If one do not use it, one should set as "NA".
 (ex.) covariate = NA (default). 
 (ex) In cotrast to the one used in aSKAT_bfiles, one must order a covariate matrix as same as "phenotype". Then, set as
 0	18	22.2
 1	43	25,2
 1	34	23.4
 1	23	28.1
 1	36	19.2
 ...	...	...
(9)"is_dose": Use dosage or not (TRUE/FALSE)

------------------------------

An example is represented in aSKAT_exe.r. 

Note: 
-Before using aSKAT_func.r, one must install SKAT package by "install.packages("SKAT")".
-We prepared a test file based on The International HapMap Project (http://hapmap.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/) for reviewers only. 
For computational easiness, only SNPs on Ch.10 are extracted for validation.
